I am currently in a dimly lit indoor environment, observing a person who appears to be engaged with their phone. My battery is at 43%, and while itâ€™s not critically low, I need to be cautious about navigation. My camera is pointed up; however, I should adjust it to look down to safely assess and identify nearby obstacles before proceeding. 

Based on this situation, I recommend **Look Down** to gather more relevant visual information about my surroundings.
